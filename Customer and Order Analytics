WHERE length(orderID) = 6 AND Product = 'iPhone';

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT distinct acctnum FROM BIT_DB.customers AS customers
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales AS February

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT Product AS cheapest_product_Jan, MIN(price) AS price FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product, price
ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1; 

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
