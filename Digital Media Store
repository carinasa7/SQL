#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about a digital media store. This includes tables for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices, and customers.

#I answered the following questions:

#1. Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US.
SELECT Customerid, FirstName, LastName, Country FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country <> "USA";

#2. Show only the Customers from Brazil.
SELECT FirstName, LastName FROM chinook.customers WHERE Country = "Brazil";

#3. Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of Invoice and billing country.
SELECT FirstName, LastName, InvoiceId, InvoiceDate, BillingCountry FROM chinook.customers
INNER JOIN chinook.invoices
ON customers.CustomerId = invoices.CustomerId
WHERE Country = "Brazil";

#4. Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.
SELECT FirstName, LastName FROM chinook.Employees
WHERE Title = "Sales Support Agent";

#5. Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.
SELECT distinct BillingCountry FROM chinook.invoices;

#6. Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.
SELECT InvoiceID, InvoiceDate,
CASE
WHEN SupportRepId = 3 THEN "Jane Peacock"
WHEN SupportRepId = 4 THEN "Margaret Park"
WHEN SupportRepId = 5 THEN " Steve Johnson"
END as "Sales Agent"
FROM chinook.customers
JOIN chinook.invoices
ON customers.CustomerID = invoices.CustomerId;

#7. Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.
SELECT invoices.InvoiceId, customers.FirstName as Customers_FirstName, customers.LastName as Customers_Lastname, customers.Country, invoices.Total as Invoice_Total,
CASE
WHEN SupportRepId = 3 THEN "Jane Peacock"
WHEN SupportRepId = 4 THEN "Margaret Park"
WHEN SupportRepId = 5 THEN " Steve Johnson"
END as "Sales Agent"
FROM chinook.customers
JOIN chinook.invoices
ON customers.CustomerID = invoices.CustomerId;

#8. How many Invoices were there in 2009?
SELECT COUNT(InvoiceId) AS Invoices_in_2009 FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate like '2009%';

#9. What are the total sales for 2009?
SELECT ROUND(SUM(Total),2) as Total_Sales_2009 FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate like '2009%';

#10. Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT InvoiceLineId, tracks.Name FROM chinook.invoice_items
JOIN chinook.tracks
ON invoice_items.TrackId = tracks.TrackId
ORDER BY InvoiceLineId;

#11. Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT invoice_items.InvoiceLineId, tracks.Name AS purchased_track_name, artists.Name AS artist_name FROM tracks
JOIN artists
ON tracks.AlbumId = albums.AlbumId
JOIN albums
ON albums.ArtistId = artists.ArtistId
JOIN invoice_items
ON invoice_items.TrackId = tracks.TrackId
ORDER BY InvoiceLineId;

#12. Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.
SELECT tracks.Name AS track, albums.Title AS album, media_types.Name AS media_type, genres.Name AS genre FROM tracks
JOIN albums
ON tracks.AlbumId = albums.AlbumId
JOIN media_types
ON tracks.MediaTypeId = media_types.MediaTypeId
JOIN genres
ON tracks.GenreId = genres.GenreId;

#13. Show the total sales made by each sales agent.
SELECT employees.FirstName as sales_agent_first_name, employees.LastName as sales_agent_last_name, Round(SUM(invoices.Total),2) as total_sales
FROM customers
JOIN employees
ON customers.SupportRepId = employees.EmployeeId
JOIN invoices
ON customers.CustomerId = invoices.CustomerId
GROUP BY employees.FirstName;

#14. Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?
SELECT employees.FirstName as sales_agent_first_name, employees.LastName as sales_agent_last_name, Round(SUM(invoices.Total),2) as total_sales
FROM customers
JOIN employees
ON customers.SupportRepId = employees.EmployeeId
JOIN invoices
ON customers.CustomerId = invoices.CustomerId
WHERE invoices.InvoiceDate like '2009%'
GROUP BY employees.FirstName 
ORDER BY total_sales desc LIMIT 1;
